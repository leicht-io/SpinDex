# astraeus (WIP)
Astraeus is a small RPM measurement tool mainly made for the Beogram 4000 series as a proof of concept.
The main focus is to verify that the turntable is restored correctly and maintains the correct speed over a longer period.
It is currently written to run on the Arduino Nano but could easily be ported to other microcontrollers, architectures and footprints.

This mono repository is divided into multiple sub-repositories explained below:


### 3D Files (3d-files):
The model consists of three models:
- astreaus_body_v1.stl
- astreaus_bottom_v1.stl
- astreaus_led_v1.stl

I usually print them in black PLA.

### Desktop App (desktop-app)
A multi-platform desktop client made with Electron receives the output from the controller and shows a temporal line graph with the results. Still needs finetuning.

Note: On Ubuntu-based OS you might need to remove brltty: *sudo apt remove brltty*

### Android App (android-app)
Android application with bluetooth support. (WIP, needs new controller with support for BLE).

---

### ÂµController Source Code (controller-source)
Source code for the microcontroller.
Setup for CLion and PlatformIO:
https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/shell-commands.html#piocore-install-shell-commands

### Documentation (documentation)
TO BE RELEASED. Circuit diagrams showing how the screen and IR sensor are attached.

Please note that this is a proof of concept and the following is missing for it to be considered finished:

- tests
- refactoring the codebase
- schematics

The following features would be needed or to have in the future:
- ESP32-C3 (for BLE and WiFi support) (https://gist.github.com/sekcompsci/2bf39e715d5fe47579fa184fa819f421)
- bigger screen.
- support for other turntables.
- headless edition with battery, Bluetooth and mobile application.
- custom-made PCB.

Feel free to develop further on the project and create PRs if, necessary. I would be happy to cooperate with others on the device.
